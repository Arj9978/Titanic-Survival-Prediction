# Streamlit Titanic Survival Prediction
Welcome to the Streamlit Titanic Survival Prediction repository! This interactive web application is designed to predict the survival chances of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, one of the most famous maritime disasters in history. By using machine learning algorithms, the application analyzes various passenger features and provides an estimation of survival likelihood.

# About the Titanic Dataset
The dataset used in this project is derived from the original Titanic passenger manifest. It contains a rich set of information about each passenger, such as age, gender, ticket class, cabin, fare, and other relevant attributes. By training a machine learning model on this data, we can make predictions on whether an individual would have survived the tragic event.

# How to Use the Application
Using this Streamlit application is straightforward and user-friendly. Simply follow the steps below:

1. Input Passenger Information: Enter the necessary details about the passenger, including their age, gender, ticket class, and other relevant information.
2. Click on "Predict": Once you've provided all the required information, click on the "Predict" button to generate the survival prediction.
3. View the Result: The application will display the predicted outcome, indicating whether the passenger would have survived or not.
4. Explore Additional Features: Feel free to explore the various features and options available within the application, such as data visualization, analysis, and model performance evaluation.
